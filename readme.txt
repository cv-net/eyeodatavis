What you will learn in this workshop:

1. Learn how to find, extract, and import data.

2. Use THREE.js and other tools to visualize this data.

Getting Started

1. Everyone: Download dl.dropbox.....
Extract files to your desktop.

2. Run a webserver

MAC USERS:

Open up a terminal (command+space and type terminal and hit enter)

Navigate to your desktop (cd ~/Desktop)
and then into the extracted folder (cd EyeO\ Data\ Vis\ Workshop/)

Run a SimpleHTTP server (python -m SimpleHTTPServer)


PC USERS:
Mongoose??
Cygwin??

3. Open up a webrowser and navigate to localhost:8000 (MAC USERS) or whatever port your web host software is using.

4. Open up a text editor and source code (start with visualization.js)

5. Start hacking!

(Reference: http://threejs.org/docs/ )

Other libraries you might run into:
dat.gui, a quick and easy way to create sliders and dropdown menus
(Reference: http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage )

two.js, a 2d animation library, used here for reading SVG data

JQuery, for wrangling html and DOM cross compatibility
(Reference: http://oscarotero.com/jquery/ )

Underscore.js, a swiss-army-knife for Javascript
(Reference: http://underscorejs.org/ )
